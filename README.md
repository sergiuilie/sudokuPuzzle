# Sudoku Puzzle

This sudoku solver works for a table with required size of 9x9.

There are 2 ways to check this implementation: 
- or clone the master branch and run SudokuTest
- or switch to gitpod-playground branch [https://github.com/sergiuilie/sudokuPuzzle/tree/gitpod-playground] and press GitPod button situated next to Clone/Download (recommended) 


Further info for GitPod: - in order to check the implementation on GitPod I couldn't make it run from the unitTest so I added a check from the main class; if you do not see the snippet (Run) above the main class after the workspace initialized please install [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-test] (it should be there)
- you need to install GitPod extension -> Gitpod - Dev Environments in a Browser Tab
